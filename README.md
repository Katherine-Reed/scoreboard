A solo project (i.e. no help from tutors) from Scrimba Pro based on counter app tutorial.

Original project was for a Home/Away scoreboard for a physical game (e.g. football).
Since I prefer tabletop games which usually involve four players, I created an app which keeps track of four players sitting around a table.
Use CSS grid to create a 3×3 layout.
Use CSS transform to rotate counters 90°, -90° and 180° so players can clearly see their scores from different sides of the table.
